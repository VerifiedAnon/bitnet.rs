## ‚≠ê Special Finding

**[Summary]**: `SAFE vs OPTIMAL Shader Comparison`  
This report shows each test run with both the SAFE (bitnet_kernel.wgsl) and OPTIMAL (bitnet_kernel_optimal.wgsl) kernels. Compare pass/fail status and timings to see which kernel is compatible and faster on your setup. If OPTIMAL fails on DX12 or is much faster elsewhere, this will be clear in the table above. Use this to guide further kernel development and DX12 workarounds.
